## 📖 About

This project analyzes 100,000+ movie ratings to find patterns in user preferences and recommends similar movies. If you liked a particular film, the system identifies other movies that users with similar tastes also enjoyed.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Recommendations**: Uses cosine similarity to find movies with similar rating patterns
- **Interactive Interface**: Clean, user-friendly web app built with Streamlit
- **Customizable Results**: Adjust the number of recommendations (5-20 movies)
- **Real Dataset**: Powered by the MovieLens 100K dataset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning (cosine similarity)
- **Streamlit** - Web application framework
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: Loads and cleans 100K movie ratings
2. **Matrix Creation**: Builds a user-movie rating matrix
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between movies based on rating patterns
4. **Recommendation**: Returns top N most similar movies to your selection
